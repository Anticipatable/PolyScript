# How I Came Up With This
So uh one day I got bored and was on [Polytoria](https://polytoria.com/) then I was like hey I should make some sorta script! So Here it is. Your welcome lmao

# Installation
Kinda depends if you want it to use [random ids](https://github.com/Anticipatable/PolyScript/tree/main/PickRandomNumber) or do each [one by one](https://github.com/Anticipatable/PolyScript/tree/main/OneByOne).
Anyways, then you just wanna choose which one you wanna use like lets say you wanna [auto favorite items one by one](https://github.com/Anticipatable/PolyScript/blob/main/OneByOne/AutoFavoriteItems.js)
Copy the code then go to any [Polytoria](https://polytoria.com/) Page and do inspect element and paste in console ez and it works
